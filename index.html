  <h3>What is Nabemono?</h3>
</div>
<div class = "Info-Body text-start">
  <p>Nabemono, often referred to as "nabe," is a popular Japanese stew that's particularly enjoyed during the colder months. The term "nabe" literally means "pot," reflecting the communal style in which these dishes are often cooked and served right at the dining table. Nabemono is a broad category that includes a variety of hot pot dishes, characterized by their preparation in a donabe (a traditional Japanese earthenware pot) or a deep skillet. Ingredients can vary widely but typically include a mix of meats (like chicken, pork, beef, or seafood), vegetables (such as cabbage, mushrooms, and green onions), tofu, and sometimes noodles or dumplings, all simmered together in a flavorful broth. There are several popular types of nabemono, each with its own distinct ingredients and broth flavors. This one is Mizutaki. A chicken based one. </p>
